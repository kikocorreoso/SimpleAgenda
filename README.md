============

An android app made using a webview and a HTML5 app made with Brython

____________________________

This is just a **proof-of-concept**.

It is an android app made in HTML5 using Python ([Brython](http://www.brython.info)) instead of javascript as the scripting language. It runs as a standalone app so no internet connection is required. It uses the browser (Webview) localstorage to store the info.

If you want to install it just download the [*SimpleAgenda.apk*](https://github.com/kikocorreoso/SimpleAgenda/blob/master/bin/SimpleAgenda.apk?raw=true) file to your mobile and install it.

**[DISCLAIMER]**: I have no idea of android development so the specific files (Java and xml files) related to the android app itself could be wrong. The HTML5 app is in [here](https://github.com/kikocorreoso/SimpleAgenda/tree/master/assets/www).
